A dispatch and investment model to represent power sector with only renewable energies as supply technologies (Offshore and Onshore wind, PV, Hydro and biogas) and Li-Ion Battery, PHS (pumped hydro storage) and methanation as storage technologies, including reserve requirements.

Offshore and onshore wind power, Solar power and biogas capacities as well as battery and power-to-gas (methanation) storage capacities are chosen endogenousely, while hydroelectricity technologies (dams & reservoirs, run-of-river and Phumped hydro storage) capacities are chosen exogenousely. All hourly power production profiles are also modelled endogenously for optimization of dispatch. 

Linear optimisation by CPLEX on GAMS using one-hour time step with respect to total cost.
