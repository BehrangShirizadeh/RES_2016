French power sector financial modelling for only renewable energies as supply technologies (Offshore and Onshore wind, PV, Hydro and biogas) and Li-Ion Battery, PHS (pumped hydro storage) and hydrogen storage (both pure H2(g) and CH4) as storage technologies, including reserve requirements, for hourly meteo and energy consumption data of 2016.

Offshore and onshore wind power, Solar power and biogas capacities as well as battery and power-to-gas (hydrogen) storage capacity are chosen endogenousely, while hydroelectricity lake and run-of-river and Phumped hydro storage capacities are chosen exogenousely.

Existing capacities by December 2017 are also entered as lower bound of each capacity, and capital related costs for existing capacities has been considered zero.
